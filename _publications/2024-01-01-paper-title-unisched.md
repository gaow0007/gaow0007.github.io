title: "UniSched: A Unified Scheduler for Deep Learning Training Jobs with Different User Demands"
collection: publications 
excerpt: 'In this work, we present UniSched, a unified scheduler to optimize different types of scheduling objectives (e.g., guaranteeing the deadlines of SLO jobs, minimizing the latency of best-effort jobs). Meanwhile, UniSched supports different job stopping criteria (e.g., iteration-based, performance-based).'
