title: "Deep Learning Workload Scheduling in GPU Datacenters: A Survey"
collection: publications 
excerpt: 'This article surveys existing research efforts for both training and inference workloads. We primarily present how existing schedulers facilitate the respective workloads from the scheduling objectives and resource utilization manner. Finally, we discuss several promising future research directions including emerging DL workloads, advanced scheduling decision making, and underlying hardware resources.'
